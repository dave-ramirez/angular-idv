**We are excited to introduce the 1.0 release of the Identity Verification In-browser SDK.**

Identity verification In-Browser SDK lets you verify end-users by simply asking them to scan their ID and take a selfie in any web browser. Modern UX creates an intuitive and frictionless experience from beginning to end. The only thing an end-user need is a device with a front-facing camera capable of running a web browser.
